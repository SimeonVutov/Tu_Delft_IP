Pass by reference

Classes:
    IMPORTANT!
    we have a student class with two attributes:
        private String name
        private int studentNumber

    if we are inside a method in student class and have access two another student object (it is passed as a parameter)
        we can use even the private variables even though they are private. The reason is that we are inside the Student
        class and inside it we can access private variables
